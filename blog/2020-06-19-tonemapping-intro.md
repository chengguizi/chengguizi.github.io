### Schlick (1994)
Photorealistic rendering techniques, chapter Quantization Techniques for the Visusalization of High Dynamic Range Pictures

> Schlickâ€™s s-shaped curve reduces some of the problems caused by clipping however its limited dynamic range makes it only viable for MDR images.


### Tumblin (1999)
Two methods for display of high contrast images.

- tanh

### Durand (2004)

> detailed layer (LDR) + base layer (HDR)
